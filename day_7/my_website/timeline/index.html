      <h2>The MCU Timeline</h2>
      <p>With Marvel Studios recently expanding it's properties into canonical television shows like: <i>WandaVision</i> and <i>Loki</i>, it's hard to keep track of the correct order to watch all of the Marvel media.</p>
      <p id="timelineQ">So how do you watch the MCU in the chronological narrative order?</p>
      <img id="mcuTimeline" src="https://i.redd.it/bc1tchfz5ur71.png" />
      <p id="timelineP">As you can see from above, the Marvel Cinematic <b>Universe</b> has now expanded into a <b>Multiverse</b> of endless possibilities. Recent properties such as <i>Loki</i> and <i>What If...?</i>, along with the upcoming <i>Spider-man: No Way Home</i> will be dealing with the rising implications of powerful beings breaching through the barriers of the infinite universes and causing mayhem in places they do not originate from. It's very <em>timey-whimey</em> and confusing, but truly showcases the expansive planning Kevin Feige and his team at Marvel Studios have done.</p>
