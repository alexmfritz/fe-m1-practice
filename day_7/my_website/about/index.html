      <h2>What is the MCU?</h2>
      <p id="aboutPOne">The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is the culmination of multiple generations of artistic talent, creative story telling, and fantastical characters realized and brought to life on the big screen.</p>
      <p id="aboutPTwo"><img id="capComic" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.dday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Captain-america-comic-book-poster.jpg?ssl=1" />The idea of superheros as a way to inspire the collective community goes back <b>way</b> before your "friendly neighborhood" Spider-Man was slinging his way through Queens in the 1960's; or when Captain America's striped shield was first displayed to inspire our troops fighting overseas during WW2.</p>
      <p>But it wasn't until the minor success of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movie trilogy in the early 2000's with <i>Sony Pictures</i> that the spark was lit with Avi Arad, director of Marvel's film division, to build something greater. With the help of Kevin Feige and others, they formed Marvel Studios, taking the first steps down the path to building one of most beautifully immersive film franchises ever.</p>
      <p>In 2006, Jon Favreau signed on to direct Marvel's first independently financed film <i>Iron Man</i>. After facing opposition, Favreau found his lead actor with Robert Downy Jr., setting the new standard for what it meant to create a standalone superhero story. But success wasn't just found by taking a chance on the casting of Tony Stark - Marvel Studios set the precedent for all their following films with the inclusion of the "after-credits scene", introducing Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury and the reference to not just S.H.I.E.L.D., but also the Avengers - the first nod to something greater coming in Hollywood.<img id="rdjTony" src="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/iron-man-downey-jr_a_l.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1" /></p>
      <p>By 2012, not only had Iron Man already seen it's first-of-two sequels, but The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America all had been introduced with standalone films leading into the release of <i>The Avengers</i>, the studios attempt at creating the shared universe that they hinted at 5 years prior. Despite preemptive criticism concerning the amount of titular characters included in one film, the film was extremely well received and broke numerous box office records while becoming one of the highest grossing films of all time. With the release of The Avengers, the term "Marvel Cinematic Universe" had stuck and Marvel announced the end of its "Phase One" of movies, with dozens of movies slated to be released in coming years hinting at plans already in the works through Phase Three.</p>

      <p>April 2019 marked the end of the Phase Four for the MCU, culminating in a decade's worth of world-building (<i>and world-ending</i>) with Avengers: Endgame. A direct sequel to the 2018 Avengers: Infinity War, Endgame wrapped up the four-phase movie series appropriately named "The Infinity Saga", and ushered in a new era of MCU-related content moving forward. While nothing would contextually ever be the same within the MCU, the world can rely on Marvel to continue to produce media with those beloved Marvel Comic Book heroes and villains that make you connect to and feel things you never thought possible.</p>
